###

This model represents the Easy Chat product, a real-time translator used between
two or more persons (speaker and listener(s)). The originality of this product is the dynamic
behavior of this translator: a real-time translation happens, allowing listeners to hear in a
known language. Moreover, there is a practical appeal for conversations in different languages.
Language issues shall be no more a barrier to chat.
