This is the model Task Reminder. The scope of this system is to give the user a way to automatically add everyday tasks to a calendar and to organize them in small tasks to complete throughout the week. The user should be able to see and edit tasks in both an easy way (visual way through suggestions of the system) and with more detail (through editing directly a file). A generic use case for this service has been generated showing minimum functions and the actors able to interact with this system. The system should be able to export the processed data to a Third Party Calendar to enhance the flexibility of the service. This model is of moderate complexity and detail.
